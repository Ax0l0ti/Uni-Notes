# 🧠 Definitions by Topic

> [!note]+ Filters
> - **Histogram Equalisation**: By spreading out the histogram, this ramps up the contrast [Histogram equalization - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_equalization) ![[Pasted image 20251007172416.png|100]]
> - ***Cumulative density function*** = $\sum_{j=0}^i{p(j)}$ where $p()=\frac{n_i}{n}$ and $n$ is the total number of pixels 
> - **neighbourhood filter** : Reduces noise by averaging over an area (smooths edges + reduce noise)
> - **Low Pass**: Filters REMOVE High Frequency e.g Gaussian Filter (sum to 1)
> - **Derivative Filters**: can calculate Edge detection e.g Deriv of Gauss, (sum to 0)
> 


> [!bug] Detection
> **Hough Transform** : detects edges, uses Hough Voting over parameter space
> **Canny**:


> [!note]+ CNNs
> - **Definition**: Convolutional Neural Networks for image processing

> [!leaf]+ Additional Topics
> - Image classification
> - Object detection
