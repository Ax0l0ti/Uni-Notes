# 🧠 Definitions by Topic

> [!note]+ Filters
> - **Histogram Equalisation**: By spreading out the histogram, #todo 
> - *Cumulative density function* = $\sum_{j=0}^i{p(j)}$ where $p()=\frac{n_i}{n}$ and $n$ is the total number of pixels 
> - **neighbourhood filter** : Reduces noise by averaging over an area (smooths edges + reduce noise)
