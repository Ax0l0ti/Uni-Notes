# 🧠 Definitions by Topic

> [!note]- P vs NP
> - **Decision problem**: a computational problem that can be answered either "**Yes**" or "**No**"
> - **P**: Problems solvable in polynomial time with a DTM
> - **NP**: Problems verifiable in polynomial time
> - **Co-NP**:  A problem $X$ is Co-NP $\iff$ (if and only if) its complement $\bar X$ is in the class $NP$ problem. Meaning, we can confirm a given "**No**" answer from the NP in Polynomial time 
> - **NP-Completeness**: 
> - **NP-Hardness**: 

> [!leaf]+ Additional Topics
> - Cook-Levin theorem
> - SAT problem
> - Classes beyond NP (PSPACE)
