> [!tip]+ Speed run
> - **P**: Problems solvable in polynomial time.
> - **NP**: Problems verifiable in polynomial time.
> - **NP-Complete**: Hardest problems in NP; all NP problems reduce to them.
> - **P vs NP**: Major open problem asking if every problem whose solution can be verified quickly can also be solved quickly.
> - **Non-deterministic Turing Machine**: TM that can explore many possibilities simultaneously.
> - **Clique**: a Clique is a grouping of nodes all adjacent to each other

> [!example]+  Examples of Problems
> > [!flower]- Traveling salesman
> > Given N locations, can a salesman work out the quickest route to visit every location at least once?
> > This ends up resulting in $N!$ possible routes, as after the first there are $N-1$ left, hence $f(N)=N(N-1)(N-2)... = N!$
