|**Synopsis:**|"You will explore the key concepts and mathematical techniques of computational complexity. You will learn to recognize and prove that problems are NP-hard, including the central concept of NP completeness, and consider a range of examples of NP-complete problems. You will learn to prove complexity lower bounds for some models of computations (e.g., algebraic computation trees). You will explore the basics of quantum computing. "|
|**Content:**|Complexity: deterministic and non-deterministic Turing machines, the complexity class NP, versions of reducibility, NP-hardness and NP-completeness, examples of NP-complete problems (such as the satisfiability problem for Boolean formulae, clique, vertex cover, travelling salesman, subgraph isomorphism), polynomial-time approximation algorithms for NP-complete graph problems such as travelling salesman, lower complexity bounds, algebraic computation trees and their complexities, introduction to quantum computing (definitions, Deutsch and Deutsch-Jozsa algorithms).|
