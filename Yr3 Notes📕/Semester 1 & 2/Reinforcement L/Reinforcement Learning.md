|**Learning Outcomes:**|On completion of the unit, the students will be able to: 1. describe how reinforcement learning problems differ from supervised learning problems such as regression and classification; 2. formulate suitable real-world problems as reinforcement learning problems by defining a state space, an action space, and a reward function appropriate for the context; 3. apply a range of basic solution methods to reinforcement learning problems; 4. appreciate the difficulties encountered in solving large, complex reinforcement learning problems in practice.|
|**Synopsis:**|You will explore reinforcement learning as a problem-solving method, and how it differs from other fundamental techniques such as supervised and unsupervised learning. You will learn to formulate real-world problems as reinforcement learning problems, to apply basic solution methods, and to appreciate the difficulties involved in large, complex reinforcement learning problems in practice.|
|**Content:**|Topics covered normally include: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, temporal-difference algorithms, integration of planning and learning, value function approximation, and policy gradient methods.|
