> [!danger]+ 🕰️* Speed run*
> Break down of topic 
> - The **Markov property** says:
> 	“The future depends only on the **current state and action**, not on what happened before.”
> 
> - Functions best when no model given. Learns from taking actions
> - episodic means can be split in episodes
> - continuation task mean the task has no clear breaks/ last forever
> - introduced notation with which we can describe both episodic and continuing sequential problems,
> - discussed what information needs to be summarised in our state representation, in order to ensure that the **Markov property** holds, and
> - formulated sequential decision problems formally as **Markov decision processes (MDPs)**.

1. Components of MDP: states, actions, transition probabilities, rewards, and initial state distribution,
• A set of **states**: $S$
• A set of **actions** available in each state: $A(s), s \in S$
• A **transition** function: $p(s'|s, a), s \in S, s' \in S, a \in A(s)$
• A **reward** function: $r(s, a, s'), s \in S, s' \in S, a \in A(s)$
• An **initial** state distribution: $h(s), s \in S$
We will often combine $p$ and $r$ into $p(s', r | s, a).$
