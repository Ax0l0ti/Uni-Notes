> Break down of topic 
> - **Temporal Difference**: 
> - On-Policy,  Off-Policy Temporal-Difference methods.
> - The On-Policy learn action-values for a near-optimal policy that explores, not true
optimal policy.
> - Off-Policy methods use two. 
> 	- Behaviour policy $b(a|s)$ which is used to generate experience.
> 	- Target policy $\pi(a|s)$ which we want to actually learn about.
