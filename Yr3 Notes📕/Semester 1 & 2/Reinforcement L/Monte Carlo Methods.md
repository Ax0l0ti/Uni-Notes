> 
> In this lesson, we introduced **Monte Carlo (MC)** methods, a class of solution methods that learn based on full episodes of experience generated by our agents. Over the course of the lesson, we built up our understanding of how Monte Carlo methods work, and concluded by examining a concrete Monte Carlo algorithm for policy evaluation. 
> - **Don't require access to a perfect world model**,
> - **Learn solely from full episodes of agent experience** and **sample returns**,
> - how Monte Carlo updates **do not bootstrap**,
> - that, when computing sample returns, we can take either a **first-visit** or **every-visit** approach, and
> - how to implement the **first-visit Monte Carlo prediction** algorithm.

First Visit vs Every visit

First Visit algo 
$$
\begin{aligned} &\text { Input: a policy } \pi \text { to be evaluated } \\ &\text { Initialize: } \\ &\qquad \begin{array}{l} V(s) \in \mathbb{R}, \text { arbitrarily, for all } s \in \mathcal{S} \\ \textit { Returns }(s) \leftarrow \text { an empty list, for all } s \in \mathcal{S} \end{array} \\ \\ &\text { Loop forever (for each episode): } \\ &\qquad \text {Generate an episode following } \pi: S_{0}, A_{0}, R_{1}, S_{1}, A_{1}, R_{2}, \ldots, S_{T-1}, A_{T-1}, R_{T} \\ &\qquad G \leftarrow 0 \\ &\qquad \text {Loop for each step of episode, } t=T-1, T-2, \ldots, 0: \\ &\qquad \qquad G \leftarrow \gamma G+R_{t+1} \\  &\qquad \qquad \text { Unless } S_{t} \text { appears in } S_{0}, S_{1}, \ldots, S_{t-1}: \\ &\qquad \qquad \qquad \text {Append } G \text { to } \textit{Returns }\left(S_{t}\right) \\ &\qquad \qquad \qquad V\left(S_{t}\right) \leftarrow \text { average }\left(\textit{Returns }\left(S_{t}\right)\right) \end{aligned}|$$
