# ✅ **What Makes a Literature, Technology & Data Survey (LTDS)? — Summary**

A **Literature, Technology and Data Survey** is a structured academic process designed to:

### **1. Understand the Topic**
You read widely to build a foundation: key theories, methods, technologies, datasets, and debates in your research area.
### **2. Develop and Justify Your Project Idea**
You use the survey to show:
- The problem exists,
- It is meaningful,
- It is worth solving,
- And your project fits naturally into existing work.
### **3. Critically Evaluate Existing Work**
You do not simply summarise papers. Instead, you:
- Compare and contrast work,
- Identify weaknesses, gaps, contradictions,
- Identify what methods, datasets, and technologies exist,
- Connect relationships between works (builds on, complements, challenges…).
### **4. Build Towards Your Own Contribution**
The survey should lead clearly to:
- What is missing in existing work,
- What your project will add,
- Why your approach makes sense.
### **5. Write a Clear, Coherent Review**
It becomes **a proper chapter (often Chapter 2)** that:
- Organises sources logically (chronological, topic-based, method-based),
- Uses references for justification,
- Constructs an argument, not a catalogue,
- Guides the reader into your project.

In short:

📌 **The LTDS shows you understand the field, can critique it, manage literature, and justify your project’s direction with evidence.**  
It is the backbone of your dissertation.
