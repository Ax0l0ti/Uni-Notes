| **Section**                  | **Topic Coverage**                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Introduction**             | Motivation behind A-level prediction (educational inequality, admissions, policy, teacher grading).                      |
| **Literature Review**        | Prior work on educational prediction, feature selection in education, ML in ed-tech, ethical concerns.                   |
| **Data Collection**          | What data is used (e.g., prior attainment, demographics, mock grades, attendance). Ethical + GDPR considerations.        |
| **Feature Engineering**      | Transformation of raw variables, encoding categorical features, handling missing data, domain-specific feature crafting. |
| **Model Development**        | Comparison of ML algorithms (e.g., scikit-learn models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, neural nets).                |
| **Evaluation & Metrics**     | MAE, RMSE, accuracy bands, fairness/robustness checks, interpretability.                                                 |
| **Trend Analysis**           | Insights about which features most influence prediction, temporal or demographic patterns.                               |
| **Discussion / Ethics**      | Bias and fairness in educational ML, transparency, implications for schools and students.                                |
| **Conclusion & Future Work** | Summarising findings, potential policy integration, improvements in data or methodology.                                 |
