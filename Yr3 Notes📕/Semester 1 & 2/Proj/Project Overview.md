Project 1: Detecting and Analyzing Algorithmic Collusion in Dynamic Pricing Systems This project investigates the emergence of tacit collusion among AI-powered pricing algorithms in competitive markets. Building on recent research showing that Q-learning algorithms can spontaneously develop collusive pricing strategies without explicit coordination and communication, the project aims to develop detection mechanisms and analytical frameworks for identifying algorithmic collusion in real-world pricing scenarios. The research will employ (deep-) reinforcement learning simulations, game-theoretic modeling, and statistical analysis to understand how pricing algorithms learn collusive behaviours through trial-and-error interactions. Key objectives include creating early warning systems for competition authorities, developing algorithmic transparency tools, and proposing regulatory frameworks to prevent anti-competitive AI behavior while preserving legitimate algorithmic efficiency gains in pricing systems.

Neuro-symbolic biological world models

TL;DR World models provide the means to embed real world knowledge (physics, chemistry, biology, amongst others) in a model so that it aligns with what is known and not just with the data used to construct it.

**2. Intrinsically-motivated** **reinforcement learning.** This project will get you to think about what motivates human behaviour and how we can use these sources of motivation to improve computational reinforcement learning.  

Humans are motivated to do things by extrinsic and intrinsic factors. For example, a student may spend longer on an assignment because they want to get a higher grade. This student is extrinsically motivated by the grade to work more. Alternatively, another student may spend more time because they enjoy the assignment regardless of the mark they get. This student is intrinsically motivated. The difference is that the first student is motivated by the outcome of the experience, whereas the second student is motivated by the experience itself. 

The basic reinforcement learning framework uses only an extrinsically motivated reward function corresponding to a specific task. An open problem in reinforcement learning is how to create intrinsic reward functions to supplement the extrinsic task reward function. For example, humans pay attention to things that are novel. Several existing intrinsic reward functions for reinforcement learning guide the agent to seek out novelty in the environment. Your project will develop our understanding of intrinsic motivation in reinforcement learning. It will have the following structure.

1. Choose an existing method (or family of methods); understand and replicate the method and (some of) the existing results in the literature using this method.
2. Evaluate the method on different test environments to assess the method’s strengths and weaknesses. 
3. Stretch goal, if you have time and interest: Propose algorithmic improvements; evaluate their effectiveness.
