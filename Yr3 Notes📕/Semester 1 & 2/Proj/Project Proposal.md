[Student Performance Prediction: A Co-Evolutionary Hybrid Intelligence model - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050924007191)

Two modules are discussed in this paper. The first module classifies the teachers into two classes of expertise by comparing the accuracy performance of six well-known machine learning techniques namely Logistic Regression (LR), MultiLayer Perceptron(MLP), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), and Random Forest (RF). 
Second, we propose a multiclass student performance prediction model (RLCHI) built upon a combination of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that will aid the model to perceive patterns and adjustments inherently and expert teachers' opinions(CHI) from the first model that will bring invaluably contextual understanding, nuanced judgment, and a deep knowledge of pedagogy to the equation.

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) are applied to student performance models to provide stakeholders with transparent explanations of prediction rationale.

GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) mode

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and RNN architectures are particularly valuable for capturing temporal dependencies in student learning trajectories
The ANN-LSTM model, combining artificial neural networks with LSTM components, achieved approximately 70% accuracy by the end of the third month of courses, outperforming both RNN (53%) and GRU (57%) baselines.
A study integrating Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Averaged One-Dependence Estimator (A1DE) through majority voting achieved 96.88% prediction accuracy. Multi-level ensemble models demonstrated 99.50% accuracy in predicting academic performance by combining Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Multilayer Perceptron, and other algorithms.[](https://www.ej-ai.org/index.php/ejai/article/view/77)​


HANDLING DATA 
Student performance datasets frequently exhibit class imbalance (e.g., more "pass" than "fail" students). Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) effectively addresses this limitation. Studies applying SMOTE to KNN models reduced false negatives from 501 to 43 in dropout prediction, demonstrating dramatic improvements in recall performance.[](https://www.ijiet.org/vol14/IJIET-V14N8-2133.pdf)​

Binary Harris Hawks Optimization (BHHO) combined with SMOTE and boosting algorithms achieved 97.8% accuracy on multi-class prediction and 90.8% on binary classification tasks with F1-scores exceeding 0.89.[](https://www.kexuetongbao-csb.com/article/boosting-student-dropout-prediction-using-synthetic-minority-oversampling-technique-and-binary-harris-hawks-optimization)​

**Feature Selection and Engineering**

Feature selection dramatically impacts model performance. Hybrid feature selection approaches combining multiple techniques (Chi-squared, Sequential Forward Selection, Correlation-based Selection) improved prediction accuracy while reducing computational overhead. Research shows careful feature engineering can enhance performance by up to 10%, though some studies demonstrate that raw data fed directly to flexible classifiers like Random Forests can achieve comparable results without manual feature engineering.[](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X22000583)

DATASETS 

The Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD) is widely used for educational prediction research, containing data on over 30,000 students across seven courses with detailed interaction logs. This dataset has enabled comparative algorithm evaluation and benchmarking studies.[](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/349/open+university+learning+analytics+dataset)​

The Portuguese student performance dataset, available through UCI Machine Learning Repository, provides academic and socioeconomic features for mathematics and Portuguese language students.[](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.698490/full)​


**Research Directions:**

1. Integrate ensemble methods combining multiple algorithm families (tree-based, neural networks, Bayesian approaches) with explainability techniques to achieve both high accuracy and interpretability.[](https://www.iieta.org/journals/isi/paper/10.18280/isi.290524)​
    
2. Incorporate temporal modeling through LSTM/GRU architectures to enable early prediction and intervention timing optimization.[](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37089306/)​
    
3. Apply RL-based curriculum learning to optimize intervention strategies personalized to individual student trajectories rather than attempting deterministic grade prediction.[](https://ai.sony/publications/Model-Based-Meta-Automatic-Curriculum-Learning/)​
    
4. Address fairness and equity by analyzing prediction errors across demographic groups and implementing fairness-aware ML techniques.
    
5. Evaluate models on UK educational datasets (OULAD, individual school data) with A-Level specific features, avoiding over-generalization from international datasets.
    
6. Combine algorithmic predictions with teacher judgment through hybrid models that preserve teacher expertise while leveraging computational pattern recognition.
