\subsection{Teacher Interviews}
\subsubsection{What would be in the Interview?}
By interviewing teachers, the project will gain insight into real world examples of how grade prediction is done. Whilst there is already research on this done by Cambridge \cite{Cambridge_Assessment2015_methods_used_by_teachers}, collecting first-hand qualitative data will enhance the contextual understanding of current predictive practices. Within these interviews, further knowledge can be gained on the possibility of attaining real text-based data for further work. 

I have selected 3 schools in the same geographic area that I intend to interview: the private school where I worked, the public school in the same area, and a grammar school. This provides insight into any discrepancies and presents a range of responses. 

Questions I intend to ask surround grade prediction. Some examples of these are: What factors influences the schools grade prediction? What is the process for assigning grades? Is the majority of grade prediction reliant on algorithms or do teacher's expert opinions have some sway on results?
\noindent Additionally, I will ask about the possibility of accessing an anonymised student data for further analysis. Whilst the project will not rely on receiving this data, this would definitely benefit the study. 

\subsubsection{Requirements for the Interview}

For the Interview to take place, informed consent for teacher interviews must be cleared with both the school and the university ethics guidelines. This must comply with Data anonymisation and GDPR compliance.
