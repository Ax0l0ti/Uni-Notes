Here is a structured breakdown of **Advanced Computer Vision** into subtopics with **key terms/concepts**, followed by a list of good lecture notes / PDFs / course material you can use to pre-learn. Later, we can dive deeper, work through problems, etc.

## üß† Subtopics & Key Terms / Concepts

Below is how I‚Äôd decompose the ‚ÄúAdvanced Vision‚Äù module based on your synopsis and content. (As requested, I list the terms without definitions.)

|Subtopic|Key Terms / Concepts|
|---|---|
|**1. Image Processing & Low-Level Vision**|feature detection; keypoints; corners (e.g. Harris, Shi-Tomasi); scale space; Gaussian pyramid; Laplacian of Gaussian; Difference of Gaussians (DoG); blob detection; edge detectors (Canny, Sobel, etc.); non-maximum suppression; image filtering; convolution; deconvolution; denoising; compressed sensing; sparse coding; total variation (TV) regularization; wavelets; image warping; morphological operations|
|**2. Multi-Camera / Multi-View Geometry**|camera model (pinhole, intrinsic & extrinsic parameters); homogeneous coordinates; calibration; distortion; epipolar geometry; fundamental matrix; essential matrix; epipoles; epipolar constraint; rectification; correspondences; stereo vision; disparity; triangulation|
|**3. 3D Reconstruction & Depth Estimation**|depth map; stereo matching; disparity-to-depth; structure from motion (SfM); bundle adjustment; motion parallax; point cloud; multi-view stereo; scene reconstruction; SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping); depth sensors; depth fusion|
|**4. Classical vs. Learning-Based Computer Vision**|segmentation; image classification; object detection; object recognition; regression models; clustering; feature descriptors (SIFT, SURF, ORB, HOG); Bag-of-Words / Bag-of-Visual-Words; classical machine learning (SVM, Random Forest, k-means); convolutional neural networks (CNNs); fully convolutional networks (FCN); semantic segmentation; instance segmentation; region proposals (R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, YOLO, SSD)|
|**5. Contemporary Topics, Applications & Trends**|neural rendering; differentiable / inverse rendering; attention mechanisms in vision; self-supervised learning; contrastive learning; generative models (GANs, VAEs) for images; depth completion; domain adaptation; vision for robotics / AR / autonomous driving; video understanding; visual transformers; reinforcement learning in vision; multimodal vision (vision + language)|
