| **Learning Outcomes:** | After successfully completing this unit, students will be able to:<br><br>- describe common security models;<br>- discuss what it means for a given system to be 'secure';<br>- identify security weaknesses in proposed and current systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Synopsis:**          | You will learn about the security of computing systems at both the software and hardware level. You will explore common security models, learn about standard attacks such as man in the middle, identify weaknesses in given systems, and consider current legislation on computer security and data protection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Content:**           | Typical topics include: Passwords, user ids and biometrics. Current legislation such as the Data Protection Act, Freedom of Information Act, Regulatory and Investigatory Powers Act. Security within a computer: -Hardware support for security: states and memory protection. memory mapping, virtual memory and security. -The Unix Security model: chown, chgrp, setuid and chroot. Strengths and weaknesses of the Unix security model: common attacks. -The Multics security model. Capabilities. Security within networks. 'Man in the middle' attacks. Web security: OWASP top ten. |
