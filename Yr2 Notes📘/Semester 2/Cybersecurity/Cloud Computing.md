> “A security policy enforcement point positioned between enterprise users and cloud service providers”. 4 pillars:

> **Visibility** Helps IT know “what’s going on”, especially “shadow IT”. 
> **Data security** CASBs can help prevent confidential data from leaving company-controlled systems, and help protect the integrity of that data. 
> **Threat protection** A typical CASB will have some or all of: Anti-malware detection, sandboxing, packet inspection, URL filtering, and browser isolation. 
> **Compliance** Not a “magic bullet”, but uses above to help with compliance.
