## 🧠 Definitions by Topic

> [!abstract]+ Experimental Design
> - **Independent Variable**: Variable manipulated by the researcher.
> - **Dependent Variable**: The measured outcome.
> - **Between-Subjects**: Different participants in each condition.
> - **Within-Subjects**: Same participants in all conditions.
> - **Counterbalancing**: Mitigates order effects.
> - **Confounding Variable**: Uncontrolled factor that affects results.
> - **Internal Validity**: Accuracy of conclusions about causal relationships.
> - **External Validity**: Generalizability of results.

> [!tip]+ Statistical Methods
> - **Pearson Correlation**: Parametric measure of linear association.
> - **Spearman Rank Correlation**: Non-parametric, rank-based association.
> - **Chi-Square Test**: Tests frequency differences in categorical data.
> - **ANOVA**: Compares means across 3+ groups.
> - **Friedman Test**: Non-parametric alternative to repeated measures ANOVA.
> - **GLMM**: Models with fixed and random effects for non-normal data.
> - **Permutation Test**: Resamples data to test hypotheses without parametric assumptions.

> [!info]+ Data Types
> - **Nominal**: Named categories (e.g., gender).
> - **Ordinal**: Ranked data without equal intervals.
> - **Interval**: Ordered data with equal spacing, no true zero.
> - **Ratio**: Like interval but with a true zero.
> - **Discrete**: Whole number values.
> - **Continuous**: Can take any numeric value.
> - **Qualitative**: Descriptive data.
> - **Quantitative**: Numeric data.

> [!success]+ Input & Performance Models
> - **Fitts’ Law**: $T = a + b \log_2\left(\frac{D}{W} + 1\right)$; predicts time to acquire a target.
> - **Index of Difficulty**: Quantifies task complexity in Fitts’ Law.
> - **Steering Law**: Models continuous path navigation.
> - **Keystroke Level Model (KLM)**: Predicts task time using low-level operations.

> [!heart]+ Cognitive Models
> - **Mental Model**: Internal representation of external systems.
> - **Gulf of Execution**: Gap between intention and action.
> - **Gulf of Evaluation**: Gap between system output and user understanding.
> - **Cognitive Load**: Mental effort required to complete a task.
> - **Sensory Memory**: Brief storage of sensory input.
> - **Working Memory**: Short-term active memory use.
> - **Long-Term Memory**: Durable and long-lasting storage.

> [!bug]+ Perception & Attention
> - **Preattentive Features**: Instantly processed visual attributes.
> - **Visual Hierarchy**: Organizing content by importance.
> - **Gestalt Laws**: Principles of perceptual grouping (e.g., proximity, similarity).
> - **Foveal Vision**: Sharp central vision for details.
> - **Peripheral Vision**: Detects motion and broad shapes.

> [!warning]+ UI & UX Principles
> - **Affordances**: Design cues for how an object should be used.
> - **Feedback**: Immediate system response to actions.
> - **Consistency**: Uniformity in design and behavior.
> - **Nielsen’s Heuristics**: Ten usability principles for interface design.
> - **System Usability Scale (SUS)**: Questionnaire for evaluating usability.

> [!omega]+ VR, Embodiment & UX in Virtual Worlds
> - **Presence**: Sense of “being there” in VR (spatial, social, self).
> - **Avatar Realism**: Degree to which an avatar resembles a real person.
> - **Proteus Effect**: Avatar appearance influences user behavior.
> - **Embodiment**: Feeling of owning a digital body.
> - **Suggestibility**: User response to VR stimuli and narrative.

> [!leaf]+ Data Presentation & Ethics
> - **Violin Plot**: Shows distribution and quartiles.
> - **Box Plot**: Displays median, quartiles, and outliers.
> - **Bar Chart**: Compares categorical variables.
> - **Pilot Study**: Small-scale preliminary study.
> - **Bias Types**: Social desirability, attrition, self-selection.
> - **Ethical Considerations**: Informed consent, data privacy, study risk.
