## 🧠 Definitions by Topic

> [!abstract]+ Experimental Design
> - **Independent Variable**: Variable manipulated by the researcher.
> - **Dependent Variable**: The measured outcome.
> - **Between-Subjects**: Different participants in each condition.
> - **Within-Subjects**: Same participants in all conditions.
> - **Counterbalancing**: Mitigates order effects.
> - **Confounding Variable**: Uncontrolled factor that affects results.
> - **Internal Validity**: Accuracy of conclusions about causal relationships.
> - **External Validity**: Generalizability of results.

> [!tip]+ Statistical Methods
> - **Pearson Correlation**: Parametric measure of linear association. -1 inv corr, 0 no corr, 1 pos corr
> - $r=​\frac{cov(X,Y)}{σ_X​σ_Y}$​
> - **Spearman Rank Correlation**: Non-parametric, rank-based association. Closer to 1 strong corr
> - $ρ=1-\frac{6\sum{d_i^2}}{n(n2−1)}$​​
> - **Chi-Square Test**: Tests frequency differences in categorical data. $X^2$ works w Deg of Freedom
> - $X^2 = \sum{\frac{(O-E)^2}{E}}$
> - **ANOVA**: ANalysis Of Variance, Compares means across 3+ groups. 
> - $\frac{between-var}{with-var}$
> - **Friedman Test**: Non-parametric alternative to repeated measures ANOVA. 
> - **GLMM**: Models with fixed and random effects for non-normal data.
> - **Permutation Test**: Resamples data to test hypotheses without parametric assumptions.
