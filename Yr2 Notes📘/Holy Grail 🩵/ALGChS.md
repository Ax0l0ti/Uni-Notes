Master theorem for recursion
e.g 
$$\begin{aligned}
&\text{$a$ is req subproblems per layer, $b$ is rate of dividing (e.g div\&con b = 2)}  \\\\
&T(n) = aT(n/b)+ f(n) \\
&where \ f() \text{ is the recursive function O()} 
\end{aligned}
$$
$$\begin{align}  
&\text{Master Theorem (simplified) Theorem. Given the above recurrence, let $c = log_ba$.}\\ &1. \ \text{If $f(n)$ grows slower than $O(n^c)$ then $T(n) = Î˜(n^c)$.}\\ & \ \text{2. If $f(n)$ is equal to $Î˜(n^c)$ then $T(n) = Î˜(n^clogn)$.}\\ &3. \ \text{If $f(n)$ grows faster than $â„¦(n^c)$, then T(n) = Î˜(f(n)).}
\end{align}$$




Master theorem basically tells us if a recursive's $O(n)$ is based off its ==**branching**== $(case \ 1)$, ==**function**== calls $(case \ 3)$ or ==**both**== equal $(case \ 2)$

Binary search trees are a data structure supporting (somewhat) efficient insert, delete and search. They work best when balanced! Worst case unbalanced operations are $O(n)$. 15 Self-balancing binary search trees do extra work when modified, so that balance is retained. Worst case cost of operations in **AVL trees** is $O(logn)$.
