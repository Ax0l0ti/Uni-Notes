[Topic: Week 10 - Gaussian Mixture Models | CM22009 - Machine learning | Home](https://moodle.bath.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=61732&section=10)
Synopsis
• Gaussian Mixture Models 
- Latent Variable Model 
- Combine simple distributions to make complex ones 
• Maximum Likelihood 
- Identify Optimal Parameters for Probabilistic Models 
• GMM to K-Means 
- K-Means is equivalent to a 0 variance GMM (deterministic)
