> [!example] Pros & Cons of Random Trees
> Below are the advantages of disadvantages of random trees. Whilst simple, the randomness averages out but key details are lost like outliers and how results were gained.

|         Advantages         |         Disadvantages          |
| :------------------------: | :----------------------------: |
| No complex hyperparameters |  Computationally Inefficient   |
|      Does not overfit      | Reliant on the number of trees |
| Not sensitive to outliers  |  Difficult to explain results  |
