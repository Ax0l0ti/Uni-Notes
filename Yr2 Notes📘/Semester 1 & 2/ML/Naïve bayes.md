Na√Øve Bayes is based on the assumption that all data is **independent** and data follows the existing dataset

### probability equation of Given 
$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A) \times P(B|A)}{B}$

$$P(A|x_0 \cap x ... \cap x_n) = \frac{P(A) \times P(x_0|A)P( x_1|A)...P(x_n|A)}{B}$$

## Na√Øve bayes on categorical
### Gaussian Distribution
Gaussian is a type of distribution where you define standard distribution **$\sigma$** and mean $x$ 

Na√Øve has a gaussian distribution for each possible category e.g y/n would have 2 gaussian distributions
