### Why use it? 
Concept - Regular languages can't define everything. If we need to prove a language $L$ is not regular, if we can prove it cant be pumped, this proves it isn't a regular language.

### What is it? 
Pumping is the statement we can repeat 0 or infinite numbers of $y$
$[w = x(y)^*z] \in L$

>[!abstract] Proof
Let $y$ denote the word represented by the first loop, so that $w = xyz$ with $y\not =e$ and $|xy| â‰¤ n$. Then we can either remove this loop or repeat it as many times as we like i.e. $xz,xyz,xyyz,xyyyz,...$ all result in paths to an accepting states. Therefore they are all words in the language $L$

### When can it be used?
If you language regular and sufficiently long, it can be pumped
> [!example] Sufficiently long definition
> Sufficiently long means $|w|$ $\geq$ number of states
