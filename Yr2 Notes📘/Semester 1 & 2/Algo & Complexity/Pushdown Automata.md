### Transition Composition

> [!sigma]+ Transition
> A Pushdown Automata's transitions are called a **Transition Relation**
> Each Transition is comprised of 5 elements. This can be seen to have the following structure:

### State Diagram 
An example state diagram and the formal definition can be seen below in the image. This is a non-regular expression that cant be accomplished by a DFA.
