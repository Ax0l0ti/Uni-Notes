## Formal and Informal Definition 

> [!Example]+ Definitions  of a Turing Machine 
> > [!info]+ Formal Definition 
> > Formally a Turing machine is described by the following:

>  ---
> > [!flower]+ Informal Definition 
> > A Turing machine consists of two main components:
> > - **Head** ≈ ==Pointer== + the ”brain”, or control unit
> > - **Tape** ≈ an infinite memory for storing calculations, made up of individual cells
> > 

### Transition Composition

> [!sigma] Transition
> A Turing Machine's transitions are called a **Transition Relation**
> Each Transition is comprised of 5 elements. This can be seen to have the following structure: 
> $δ : (Q/H) × Σ → Q × (Σ ∪ \{L, R\})$ is the transition function
> this is structured as $δ(state_0, read) → (state_1, write, move)$
> where $move \in \{L,S,R\}$
>
