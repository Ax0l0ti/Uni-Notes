> [!heart] Big $O$
>  Big $O$ is the *Upper Bound* Complexity of a function. we say $f(n)$ is $O(g)$ if g always smaller than $f(n)$ as n lim infinite
>  **Definition**. Given a function $g(n)$, we say that “$f(n)$ is $O(g(n))$” if there exists $c > 0$ and $n_0 ≥ 0$ such that for all $n ≥ n_0 0 ≤f(n) ≤ cg(n)$ People sometimes write “$f(n) = O(g(n))$” or “$f = O(g)$”


> [!omega] Big $\Omega$
>  Big $\Omega$ is the *Lower Bound* Complexity of a function. we say $f(n)$ is $\Omega(g)$ if g always smaller than $f(n)$ as n lim infinite
>  **Definition**. Given a function $g(n)$, we say that “$f(n)$ is $\Omega(g(n))$” if there exists $c > 0$ and $n_0 ≥ 0$ such that for all $n ≥ n_0 0 ≤ cg(n) ≤f(n)$ People sometimes write “$f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$” or “$f = \Omega(g)$”


> [!flower] Big $\Theta$
>  Big $\Theta$ is the middle ground. some constants are above and below this complexity
>  **Definition**. Given a function $g(n)$, we say that “$f is Θ(g(n))$” if it is both $O(g(n))$ and $Ω(g(n))$.
>  **More explicitly:** $f$ is $Θ(g(n))$ if there are positive constants $c1 > 0, c2 > 0$ and $n_0 ≥ 0$ such that for all $n ≥ n_0 0 ≤c_1g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c_2g(n)$. Big-$Θ$ combines Big-$O$ and Big-$Ω$ to capture an exact (asymptotic) complexity
