## Sorting Algorithms

![[Big O Cheatsheet.png]]

#### Selection
for every element $i$, get the next smallest element $s$ and swap $i$ and $s$ 

![[Selection Sort.png]]

#### Insertion
sort from one side. get next small element, compare to each element till inserted into correct place of sorted list section
Loop invariant - after each iteration the array $a$ is a permutation of the og array, and the first $i$ elements are in sorted order

#### Merge Sort
Divide and Conquer
break list in half. Repeatedly break till single item lists, combine small ordered lists into bigger ordered lists


## Loop Invariant
A loop invariant is a property that holds before and after every iteration of a loop.

Generic loop code checks predicate $p$ is always true where property of $p$ being a loop invariant
```python
setup_code(); #the code we execute before entering the loop 
while (guard) { # the guard decides whether we enter the loop 
	loop_body(); # whatever the loop is doing 
} # end of loop
```


Uses:
- Helps prove correctness of an algorithm.
- Used in sorting algorithms to show that a certain property (e.g., sorted portion of an array) holds after each iteration.
Example: Insertion Sort
Invariant: At the start of each iteration, the first $ùëñ$ elements are sorted.
Proof:
- Base case: set $p$ Before first iteration, one element is trivially sorted.
- Inductive step: If first $i$ elements are sorted, inserting the $(i+1)^{th}$
correctly maintains the sorted order. 

Loop invariants are crucial in proving the correctness of algorithms like selection sort, insertion sort, and mergesort.
