# Rational Numbers $\mathbb{Q}$

A rational number is defined as the following where $A$ is a set of fractions
$$ \begin{align}  
A = {\frac{x}{y} | (x,y\subset \mathbb{R}) \wedge ( y \neq 0) } = \mathbb{z} \times (\mathbb{z} ` {0}) \\
\frac{x_1}{y_1} ~ \frac{x_2}{y_2} \text{ if and only if } x_1y_2 = x_2y_1
\end{align}
$$

1. **Natural Numbers (ℕ)**
    
    - **Symbol**: ℕ
    - **Definition**: Positive whole numbers including 0 (sometimes excluding 0 in certain contexts).
    - **Set**: ℕ = {$0, 1, 2, 3, 4, …$}
    - **Set notation**:  
        ℕ = { $n ∈ ℤ | n ≥ 0$ }
2. **Integers (ℤ)**
    
    - **Symbol**: ℤ
    - **Definition**: All whole numbers, including positive, negative numbers, and zero.
    - **Set**: ℤ = {$…, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …$}
    - **Set notation**:  
        ℤ = { $z | z ∈ ℤ$ }
3. **Rational Numbers (ℚ)**
    
    - **Symbol**: ℚ
    - **Definition**: Numbers that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers (fractions), where the denominator is not zero.
    - **Set**: ℚ = {$a/b | a, b ∈ ℤ, b ≠ 0$}
    - **Set notation**:  
        ℚ = { $q ∈ ℝ | q = a/b, a, b ∈ ℤ, b ≠ 0$ }
4. **Real Numbers ($ℝ$)**
    
    - **Symbol**: ℝ
    - **Definition**: All possible numbers that can be represented on a continuous number line, including rational and irrational numbers.
    - **Set**: ℝ includes $ℚ, π, e, √2,$ etc.
5. **Irrational Numbers ($I$)**
    
    - **Symbol**: I
    - **Definition**: Numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers, including numbers like π and √2.
    - **Set**: $I = ℝ \ ℚ$ (all real numbers excluding the rational ones)
    - **Set notation**:  
        I = { $x ∈ ℝ | x ∉ ℚ$ }
6. **Complex Numbers ($ℂ$)**
    
    - **Symbol**: ℂ
    - **Definition**: Numbers that can be expressed as a combination of real and imaginary numbers (e.g., a + bi, where i is the imaginary unit).
    - **Set**: ℂ = { $a + bi | a, b ∈ ℝ$ }
7. **Imaginary Numbers**
    
    - **Symbol**: Often denoted with "i" or ℑ.
    - **Definition**: Numbers involving the imaginary unit, i, where i² = -1.
    - **Set**: Part of complex numbers.
    - **Set notation**:  
        { $bi | b ∈ ℝ, i² = -1$ }
