# Hi! Welcome to my Uni notes 
---

Honestly, I don't expect anyone to read this or use these. **HOWEVER**, I gain nothing from making this private so its public... big ups for code communism I guess. 

Having never used online note taking, I hope this nonsense helps with one of the following
$$\begin{flalign}
a) \text{ Set up a semi-decent Obsid Repo} \\
b) \text{ Gives you a decent start on some lecture notes} \\
c) \text{ Shows you how }NOT \text{ to do a Obsid Repo} \\
\end{flalign}$$

### Structuring of Vault
> **Notes** are split by year, and linked via the Metadata Directories in each. 
> > **Holy Grails** are basically cheat sheets for all examed modules. They don't contain everything but only what I wanted or needed to review immediately before entering the exam hall.
> > **Yr Metadata** contains files related to to structuring, exam timetables and resources for my year
> 
> **T** is for my modified tag structure so I can use **SQL** via Dataview plugin 
> 
> **Templates** is for when I'm making notes, an immediate copy paste structure never hurt anyone
> 
> **Syncing & Personal** is where unrelated things go, it contains the **Playground** for testing and messing about, **Tips** for when I forget Obsidian Functionality and contains my severely outdated **Todo** list
